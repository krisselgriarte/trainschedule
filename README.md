 In this file, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate the information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. I also used HTML, CSS and Javascript with this site.
